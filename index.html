  <h1>My portfolio page</h1>
  <p>Hi,</p>
  <p>   My name is Ivan and this is my portfolio web site. The purpose of it is to upload my CV and my certificates 
        in environment created all by me. The site is hosted on bare metal machine located in my living room 
        runing Debian 10 and Apache as a web server on it. For storage I am using two drive rack mounted on the
	      CD-ROM slot as both drives are set to work as RAID 1. As a backup machine I am using Raspberry Pi running
	      Raspberry Pi OS(old Raspbian). For my home network I am using Archer C7 wireless rooter as I removed the
	      stock software and installed openWRT.</p>
      
   <p>   I would like to thank you for the time you spent cheking my page. Please stay tuned for my new accoplishments
      and new improvements on my page.</p>
  </p>
